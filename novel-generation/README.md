This is just some random stuff you can use for novel or prose generation. 
This stuff might be useful for [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/), I guess.

- _companynamegenerator_ creates random company names
- _germantowngen_ creates random German town names
- _hipsterfood_ creates random descriptions of hipster foods
- _romannamegen_ creates random Roman names
